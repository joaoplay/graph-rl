# GraphRL - Generating Graphs using Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the code for the paper "Generating Vascular Networks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach". This work is based on the GraphRL framework, which is a general framework for generating graphs using reinforcement learning. The code is written in Python and uses PyTorch for the reinforcement learning part.
